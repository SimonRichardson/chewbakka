# Chewbakka

Chewbakka is a simple actor model in Go, based on my experience with [Akka](http://www.akka.io) on Scala.

It has not been tested on production yet. You can get some samples in the `samples` directory until I write some documentation here. To run the samples, use

`go run *.go` 

inside the samples folder.
